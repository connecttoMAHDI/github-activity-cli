## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue: SSL Certificate Error
If you encounter an error like this:
```bash
Failed to fetch events: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

Follow these steps to resolve it:

1. **Download the CA Certificates**
   - Download the latest `cacert.pem` file from [this link](https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem).

2. **Save the File**
   - Save the downloaded `cacert.pem` file to:
     ```
     {path\to}\php\extras\ssl\cacert.pem
     ```

3. **Update PHP Configuration**
   - Locate your `php.ini` file using:
     ```bash
     php --ini
     ```
   - Open the `php.ini` file in a text editor.

4. **Enable Required Extensions**
   - Ensure `openssl` and `curl` extensions are enabled (remove the `;` before the lines if present).

5. **Set the `curl.cainfo` Path**
   - Search for `curl.cainfo` in the `php.ini` file and set it to the full path of your `cacert.pem` file:
     ```ini
     curl.cainfo = "{path\to}\php\extras\ssl\cacert.pem"
     ```

6. **Restart Services**
   - Restart your web server or PHP service for the changes to take effect.
